- I'm currently studying IT Security.
- As of right now (while a semester at uni isn't in progress) I occupy my time with these topics:
  - Expanding what programming languages I can actually natively program.
    - currently looking into Go and Rust
  - I "research" topics like AI (or Docker).
- I play a bunch of video games.
- I run/administrate a server (run through [Netcup](https://www.netcup.com)).
  - My server uses Docker to containerize all its different applications (this is quite often a pain in the butt, as I don't fully understand how to create containers yet).
  - Games
    - Minecraft
    - Satisfactory
    - Factorio
    - and whatever me and my friends are currently interested in
- I want to get into creating mods for games (probably mainly Minecraft at first).
- I don't motorcycle because it's cool, I motorcycle because it's fun, aside from that I don't motorcycle.
  - ~~if you got this you're more into german internet culture than I am~~
  - But I love to motorcycle.
- I love video editing and do post-processing.
- How to reach me: probably reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rmaV36gK9G) (chances are I won't react if you're not on this server, as I don't know you)
- I will eventually create video content (again) on:
  - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Xenoreaper)
  - [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/xen0reaper)
